    // filters do not work because they are probably not supported in node canvas... still... sends the picture of the shirt
    // yep https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas/issues/1373
    // blueprints to implement https://github.com/arahaya/ImageFilters.js/blob/master/imagefilters.js

    // basically server is stand alone
    // listens on particular port
    // other sites serve images directly from server
     + keep interests seperated
