# Apparel Image Generator
## Generates Colorized, Customizable Images of Apparel with Logos
## Take eCommerce Into Your Own Hands. Why share your profits?

## Why?
Use this API to generate images of apparel with logos for your eStore.

Rather than make a PSD for each variation of your product, generate them on the fly, saving hours of time and allowing you to offer far more variations than otherwise possible.

## Example
You have an eStore that sells shirts with pictures of Boston Terriers on them. You offer 4 different kinds of shirts in 10 colors (40 variations). You just got a great image for a new sweater. You upload the new image and configure it, and the API can now serve the image on 40 variations of your shirts, without touching Photoshop. 

As a further example, you decide to make a slight change to the sweater you just made. Rather than make yet another 40 png files, you simply replace the file for the logo in the API and all variations are instantly updated.

## Usage
1. Replace the values in the `assets` and `config` folders with your own custom values.
2. Deploy the API and have any other application you wish to run request and receive custom images.

### Quick start
1. Clone repository
2. Install dependencies `npm install`
3. Start server `npm start`
